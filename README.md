Including:
1. Core considerations
  - Test Driven Approach (Junit/Mockito)
  - MVC REST API
  - Async configuration
  - Spring Security based configuration
  - Error Handling Middleware
  - Request Logging Middleware
  - Spring Data/JPA (Domain/Entity/Repository)
  - Request/Response DTOs
  - Apache Spark for ML features

3. General Betting features
  - Dynamic Odds: Odds change based on trends and bets placed.
  - Outcome Prediction: Predict future outcomes based on historical data.
  - Betting Strategies Testing: Simulate strategies to optimize returns.
  - Dataset Examples.

4. Specific Stock/Forex market-like Betting features
  - API should include endpoints for:
    - Real-time data feeds: Fetch stock data (mocked or from an external API like Alpha Vantage).
    - Machine learning predictions: Use trained models to predict stock trends and provide betting odds.
    - Simulated trading strategies: Allow users to test betting/trading strategies based on historical or simulated data.

Key Points to consider:

- Cross-Validation: Added with parameter tuning for regParam and elasticNetParam.
- Feature Scaling: StandardScaler ensures all features have the same scale.
- Pipeline: Streamlines preprocessing and training steps.
- Apache Spark for Big Data: Efficient for processing large-scale historical stock datasets.
